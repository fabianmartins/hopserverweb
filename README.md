# hopserverweb

 HopServerWeb is a simple web version of HopServer.
 
 HopServer gets list of servers (in the form server:port) where an instance of
 HopServer is deployed and calls the first server on the list and send it the
 remaining servers on the list. By this way, we can go through a series of
 servers checking if the servers are available and accessible through those
 ports.
